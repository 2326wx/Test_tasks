# Brain 3D CT images labeling

## Task

You have several brain CT images, labeled by 20 classes. Images were rotated before labeling, and each image has respective txt file with rotation data.

Your task is to create a tool, which labels new images in a same way.

Provide results in Jupyter Notebook, write report in pdf or other format.

## Hi-level solution algoritm

1. De-rotate images.
2. Make an exploratory analysis and pre-process images if needed.
3. Select the classifier architecture and metrics and explain your selection.
4. Train classifier and estimate its quality by selected metrics.
